# Video Game Development
A collection of scripts I used for different projects. Primarily minor game jam scripts.

Ideally I aim to update this fortnightly.
My goal is 6 minimal viable product (MVP) games over 2022. Think the scale of a Game Jam.

I however unfortunately do not get a lot of free time to work on game projects so do not execpt too much.
